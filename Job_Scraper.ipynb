    "## Vision\n",
    "Want to train an ai to webscrape unique websites (After:: already  exist routine based): \n",
    "\n",
    "### Obvious Limitations\n",
    "- Bott Checks, will have to first create an algorithm that can pass most \"Captcha\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- Misidentified parsing information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Invalid Selection Options, misunderstood from bott's perspective\n",
