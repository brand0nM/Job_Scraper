    "3 titles I want to search across 4 platforms and google: Dice, Indeed, Monster, and Ziprecruiter.\n",
    "Can easily Create 5 seperate case class objects that extend a \"Search\" Abstraction, \n",
    "meaning each website will have to manual be instantiated\n",

    "## Vision\n",
    "Want to train an ai to webscrape unique websites (After:: already  exist routine based): \n",
    "\n",
    "### Obvious Limitations\n",
    "- Bott Checks, will have to first create an algorithm that can pass most \"Captcha\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- Misidentified parsing information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Invalid Selection Options, misunderstood from bott's perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "- User needed text inputs- outside of myself (Could create my own Brandon chat bott)\n",

    "**Need to explore different algos for this probably a lot for most basics (Identify, right-side-up, etc.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "These limitations are vsat enough to put this part of the project on hold at the moment, maybe when I get more experience as a software engineer but this skillset will be pretty.. involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trouble Shooting\n",
    "Webdriver is shitty.. Most likely you are running this from the M1. \n",
    "\n",
